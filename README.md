# TicTacToeProject

Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

# About the project

We are building a Tic Tac Toe Game with 2 Difficulty Levels from Scratch using jQuery


# Technologies used 

We have used during this project the following :

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- JQuery

​
## Getting Started
​
We built a Tic Tac Toe game using two difficulty levels, easy and hard and we have implemented complex logic using jQuery
We have used HTML to create buttons to either select a difficulty mode or play again. We have also created a grid of 9 squares that using CSS, we were able to center the Xs and Os and style the game in a way to give us a very close duplicate of the gam.

We then used JavaScript and JQuery to implement different methods and logics 
For the easy level, we have used a Math.random method so the computer can use a random square without taking in consideration the move that the user made
For the hard level, we implemented several logics for each move in a way that the computer will take consideration of the user's move then defend the corners before attacking and trying to win the game

Once the game is over, it will display whether you have won, lost or drew then it will give you the option to play again


if the user chooses s5 the computer will pick s1, the computer takes s5 for any other move
